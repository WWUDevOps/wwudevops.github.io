# How to contribute

We'd love to get feedback from students to improve the project, this is here for you guys so we want you to be a part of the development.

## Getting Started
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com)
* Submit a ticket for you issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue or improvement.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

## Making Changes
If you feel you can make the improvement or fix yourself follow these  steps to get it merged  in.

* Work from your fork of the repository NOT a cloned version of the organizations.
* Make commits of logical units when you make changes.
* Make sure commit messages are meaningful and properly formatted.
* Test all changes when you think it's finished.
* Submit a pull request for review.

Members of the club who have push access to the repository will review the changes and merge them in if they agree. Make sure to monitor the pull requests, we will be commenting on them if there are things we think need to change before they are merged.
